This path led him through diverse workplaces (European Space Agency, Idiap Research Institute, Microsoft, Google) and countries (Germany, Switzerland and the UK). He likes to find neat solutions for real world problems."
            data-talkDesc="The combination of neural networks, reinforcement learning and great computational power has recently led to impressive results in complex games, even surpassing human level performance. In this short talk, we will introduce some of the basic concepts and building blocks of Deep Reinforcement Learning, assuming no previous familiarity with the field. We will also highlight some of the open problems and challenges faced when applying deep RL to the real world.">

This talk combines the different moments of my agile journey through Scrum, Kanban and operations at database and application levels, towards DevOps culture, values and practices.
To overcome this challenge, practices like source control, continuous integration and continuous delivery were applied to databases development allowing to narrow the gap between application and database development. I will explore the different challenges of each team, development & operations, during this journey in order to build a communication/collaboration mechanism able to manage changes.">

We will share with you lessons learned along the way and touch subjects such as:  how we integrated the new platform into our existing load balancer infrastructure, how we achieved zero impact deployments, how we rebuilt our CICD pipeline, how we manage authorization and authentication for the new platform in a decentralized manner and how we adapted our monitoring and alerting infrastructure."

I will share the rationale behind the decisions we took while moving from PHP to GoLang+Node.js. I will explain why we became early adopters of Webcomponents and Polymer. Additionally, I will share the cultural changes introduced in the company while promoting increased ownership, empowerment and risk awareness.
I also will describe how we moved from a 2-week release cycle into continuous delivery by building an automation layer supporting the release process, while promoting a focus on smaller, less risky and more frequent releases.
This won’t be a “recipe for success” talk (there is no such thing) but an attempt to share some lessons learned during our current journey."

From that time onwards, a lot has changed... Let's embark on a 10 year trip to see if we can now Make Android Great Instead!"

            data-talkDesc="In this presentation I will talk about the victories and challenges of security testing applications and the benefits it can bring to improve software born of current fast paced development and deployment environments. I will share some common security issues found in web applications, and discuss how an holistic approach to security, closely knit into the Software Development Life Cycle, can help companies large and small develop better and safer code."

            data-bio="Júlio is a software engineer who started 4 companies. He's one of the founders of Life on Mars, a Porto-based software team with sky-high standards and aspirations. He's also the CTO of Fractal, a Berlin-based blockchain tech company. To this day, he has no idea what he's doing, but somehow keeps merrily chugging along in blissful oblivion."
            data-talkDesc="Blockchain technology, coupled with cryptoeconomics, allows us to confidently approach a whole new class of problems. It's a force for good, bringing censorship resistance to a global economy. In this short talk, I'll give you a short overview of the ecosystem, covering decentralization, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and ICOs."
