Previously Antonio was Glasses Group Global’s CTO, supervising the development of a global glasses marketplace; Jumia’s CTO @ Africa Internet Group | Rocket Internet, supervising the development the largest eCommerce platform for Africa and Middle East; CTO @ UNEDGED, supervising the development of innovative interactive software."
            data-talkDesc="In this talk I will share the tales from EdirectInsure’s journey from a PHP monolith into a distributed platform, based on a micro-service architecture.
I will share the rationale behind the decisions we took while moving from PHP to GoLang+Node.js. I will explain why we became early adopters of Webcomponents and Polymer. Additionally, I will share the cultural changes introduced in the company while promoting increased ownership, empowerment and risk awareness.
I also will describe how we moved from a 2-week release cycle into continuous delivery by building an automation layer supporting the release process, while promoting a focus on smaller, less risky and more frequent releases.
This won’t be a “recipe for success” talk (there is no such thing) but an attempt to share some lessons learned during our current journey.">

This talk combines the different moments of my agile journey through Scrum, Kanban and operations at database and application levels, towards DevOps culture, values and practices.
To overcome this challenge, practices like source control, continuous integration and continuous delivery were applied to databases development allowing to narrow the gap between application and database development. I will explore the different challenges of each team, development & operations, during this journey in order to build a communication/collaboration mechanism able to manage changes.">

From that time onwards, a lot has changed... Let's embark on a 10 year trip to see if we can now Make Android Great Instead!">
