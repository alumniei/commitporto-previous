            data-talkDesc="Marketing analytics exists to empower decision makers with real valuable solutions, to turn bytes into actions. However, many companies struggle to realize the full potential of their analytical efforts and face even more difficulties in realizing the power of a Customer Centric marketing strategy.<br />These pictures need to be placed over real customer and business knowledge added with technical and advanced analytical skills. And this relies on people.<br />Companies need to adapt themselves to the new world… analytics can help them."

He is the author of several papers, his main research topics are machine learning with side information, unsupervised learning and machine translation. João is one of the co-founders of the Lisbon Machine Learning Summer School (LxMLS). "

On these companies, he has delivered worldwide projects that involved thousands of daily transactions and many GBs of data.<br />In terms of technologies, although the first years were focused mainly on iOS applications, he has now moved into big data and AI when he joined Movvo and later Feedzai.<br />Mauro loves sports, is a serious console gamer (Xbox One fan) and it's keen on bonsai trees."
            data-talkDesc="When you work on SaaS projects and things go wrong you can “easy” change and adapt the code releasing it on the same day with minimum downtime. On the other side, there are times where your products require you to deliver them in closed/controlled environments. In iOS and Fintech your installations run on your client and you have little control over it. We will go through those not so easy environments and things you can do to ease this pain and reduce this barrier."

He's still there, but now oversees the in house apps from a technical perspective. Luís loves gadgets, politics, football history, pasta, and all dogs, but mostly the one's in the family."
            data-talkDesc="Code costs money, and it has value. Quick delivery demands result in not always following the best practices. Most of the knowledge that's linchpin to software is not always in documentation or testing but on the developers. And then the project is transferred to a different development center… Let's discuss how to actively support a live app while growing into a sane development setting."

These are the systems we work for, transform and deliver. Powering UX at such systems is an everyday challenge.

            data-talkDesc="The world is changing! It seems a cliché but the change is real. Mobile has taken over our lives and people are used to text each others. Remember that Facebook paid $19B for WhatsApp? With users spending lot of time on messaging applications, the latest trend was born - Chatbots. Though they seem as simple as exchanging messages between 2 ends, they are becoming a powerful platform for building flows/applications very quickly using an interface where users feel at home. We will explore chatbots, their underlying mechanisms, the challenges we faced while building a chatbot platform and how we solved them (or not)."

            data-talkDesc="In a company that was used to test the features in a more manual way, the continuous growth and the evolution to continuous delivery makes that the test mindset had to change. The way we were used to perform testing changed to adapt to the new needs of Continuous Delivery, where we need to be fast to validate the increasing number of builds while not losing confidence on the quality of the delivery."

            data-bio="Miguel is a Software Engineer usually working on backend development and infrastructure. In the past couple of years he's been happy building things at Mindera. His previous experience had him working with the folks at Portugal Telecom and Blip. When not working with computers, he enjoys gaming and being an avid indoor enthusiast."
            data-talkDesc="In the days of rising clouds, self-healing infrastructures and stupidly cheap disks, developers often work around performance and capacity issues by throwing hardware at problems. This talk is about NOT doing that. Instead, it is about understanding the inner workings of languages and platforms and how we can use that knowledge for our own fun and profit. You can expect to hear about Java, Performance and Strings. Strings are exciting aren't they?">

For a little over a decade now, he has been fortunate to work on diverse projects bringing together web, distributed systems, APIs, scaling and security. Currently working for Web Summit, building software to power some of the world's largest conferences. Strong believer in changing the world, and a fan of great cooking."
            data-talkDesc="Registration of attendees sits at the core of running a conference. When running conferences in different cities and timezones – from Lisbon to Hong Kong to New Orleans –, the number of variables that can (and will!) go wrong increases drastically. In this talk, we'll explore the tale of how Ruby, Saltstack and CouchDB mix together with good software architecture and complex distributed systems to produce a world-class level of service."
