      <h2 class="header-call-for-speakers" id="faqs">FAQs</h2>
      <h3>What is the duration of the talk?</h3>
      The times for the presentations should range 20-25 minutes and another 5 minutes for Q&amp;A. The total time should not exceed 30 minutes.

      <h3>Can I promote my company/product?</h3>
      The speakers of Commit Porto are invited for their expertise with the goal of sharing their experience tackling challenges in software development. We don’t impose any restrictions on the content of the presentation, but ask you to not focus on promoting your organization or particular products.

      <h3>Do I need to present in English?</h3>
      Yes. Fortunately, Porto is becoming a more and more multi-cultural city everyday and we want to make sure every talent out there can attend the event.

      <h3>Am I allowed to submit multiple talks?</h3>
      Well, the short answer is: yes. The long one is: our resources are limited and we are not expecting to review 5 applications per person but if you have 2 or 3 great options and can't decide which one will fit better, you are more than welcome to submit both.

      <h3>Any other questions?</h3>
